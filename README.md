# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic tac toe made with Linux Systems calls.

How to play Tic_tac_toe.
1) Start 3 Linux terminals.
2) Compile the F4Server.c and the F4Client.c
3) Run 1 server with: ./server dim1 dim2 token1 token2.
4) the max dim for the field is 15x15 but you can modify the code if you want a bigger matrix, the tokens must be different.
5) Run 2 server with:  ./client NameG1.
6) keep playing until 1 client win.

If you want to play against the bot simply compile the bot , run a server , and then ran the client as: ./client name /*    ( "/*" this run the bot).


This is the summary of the documentation because the full documentation about the singlas, or other thecnical stuff is in italian, and yea even the comments and the code is mainly in italian, soon or later im gonna do a full refactor.

I hope you will enjoy.
